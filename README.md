An airline company provides air transport services for traveling passengers and flight. Airlines use aircraft to supply these services and may form partnerships or alliances with other airlines for codeshare agreements, in which they both offer and operate the same flight. Generally, airline companies are recognized with an air operating certificate or license issued by a governmental aviation body. Airlines may be scheduled or charter operators.

Airlines assign prices to their services in an attempt to maximize profitability. The pricing of airline tickets has become increasingly complicated over the years and is now largely determined by computerized yield management systems.

The price of an Airline Ticket is affected by a number of factors, such as flight duration, days left for departure, arrival time and departure time etc. Airline organizations may diminish the cost at the time they need to build the market and at the time when the tickets are less accessible. They may maximize the costs. As well it helps the travelers to save time and money and they can easily budget there trips. The price may relay upon different factors. Each factor has its own proprietary rules and algorithms to set the price accordingly. Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) makes it possible to infer such rules and model the price variation.

About Dataset :

Link to Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikhilmittal/flight-fare-prediction-mh

We have 2 datasets here — training set and test set.

The training set contains the features, along with the prices of the flights. It contains 10683 records, 10 input features and 1 output column — ‘Price’.

The test set contains 2671 records and 10 input features. The output ‘Price’ column needs to be predicted in this set.

We will use Regression techniques here, since the predicted output will be a continuous value.
